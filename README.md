A farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
chickens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs
The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that reads data from a file and returns the total number of legs of all the animals. Information about all farmer’s animals is stored in the animals.json file. Here is an example of an animals.json file:
{
“pigs”: 6,
“chickens”: 12,
“cows”: 21
}
Return the result in a suitable way
